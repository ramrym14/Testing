    "The test failed due to an incorrect credential issue during login, preventing further interaction with the application.",
    "The frontend UX message 'Incorrect credentials, please try again!' indicates a login error. The backend log also shows a timeout, but this appears to be unrelated as it occurred during the click action on the user icon, not during the login process.",
    "Ensure that correct credentials are provided for login before proceeding with further test steps."
