  "type": "Timeout",
  "explanation": [
    "The test execution timed out while waiting for the expected element '.swal-modal'.",
    "The frontend UX does not display an error related to a timeout, but the error log indicates a wait-for-element operation timed out.",
    "Consider adjusting the wait time for the locator.waitFor function or ensuring that the expected element is available and visible before the test executes."
