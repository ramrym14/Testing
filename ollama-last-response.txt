    "The test failed due to incorrect login credentials.",
    "The frontend UX displayed an 'Incorrect credentials' error, which correlates with the UI message. The backend log also shows a timeout, but it appears this is related to locating the user icon (a.profile-button) rather than the login attempt itself.",
    "Ensure that the correct username and password are being provided during login. Also, investigate if there's any issue in the locator strategy for the user icon."
