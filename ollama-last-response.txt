    "The error is related to the incorrect credentials provided during login.",
    "The UX message 'Incorrect credentials, please try again!' matches the error in the test script where it tries to click the user icon but times out waiting for the locator ('a.profile-button').",
    "Ensure that the correct username and password are being used. Also, check if the login page DOM is properly loaded before attempting to interact with it."
